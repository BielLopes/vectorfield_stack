# ground_robot


This package uses the distancefield package to support a controller for ground robots. It can be used to control a diferential drive or a skid-steering robot. Two types of input controls are available, (i) linear and angular speeds, and (ii) wheels speeds. It can be checked with the differential and skid-steering robots available in the robotsim package.
